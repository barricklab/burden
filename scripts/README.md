# burden

## Preparing Data

The burden analysis requires two input files:

  1. **Metadata file** (CSV or TSV format)

      Describes the sample in each well of a microplate

  2. **Platereader file** (CSV or TSV format)

      Containing the signals (OD600, GFP, et.c) recorded in each well over a time course of grouth

### Metadata file format

This is a comma-separated values (CSV) or tab-separated values text file (TSV) describing the layout of wells and sample that you must create in a text editor or Excel for each plate that you want to analyze.

Column Descriptions:
* **well** - column (letter) and row (number) of the well on the microplate
* **strain** - the strain/construct that was placed in that well. You _cannot_ use a double underscore "__" in strain names!
   * Use **blank** or *b* in the **strain** column for wells that contain only medium and no cells.
* **include** - _optional_ column determining whether to include this well in the analysis. Set it to false to remove wells with technical problems. (0/F/false/blank = no, 1/T/true= yes)
* **isolate** - _optional_ column with a number, letter, or name designating different versions of the same strain. For example, different colonies picked after a transformation that might have genetic differences in the plasmids/chromosomes could be labeled A, B, C,. Different values here represent different _biological replicates_ for a given construct. This value will be ignored for **blanks**.
* **description** - _optional_ column with additional information

Example excerpt from a file showing different types of data and formats:
```text

B2    blank   F       T               just LB
B3    blank   F       T               just LB
B4    Test1   F       T       A       test strain 1, transformant A, tech repl 1
B5    Test1   F       T       A       test strain 1, transformant A, tech repl 2

B10   blank   F       F               contaminated
B11   blank   F       F               forgot to inoculate
B12   blank   F       F               outlier
C1    Ctrl1   T       T               control strain 1, tech repl 1
C2    Ctrl1   T       T               control strain 1, tech repl 2
C3    Ctrl1   T       T               control strain 1, tech repl 3
C4    Ctrl2   T       T               control strain 2, tech repl 1
C5    Ctrl2   T       T               control strain 2, tech repl 2
C6    Ctrl2   T       T               control strain 2, tech repl 3
```
Each of the wells that has the same **strain** and **isolate** are considered together as _technical replicates_.

### Platereader file format

This is a comma-separated values (CSV) or tab-separated values text file (TSV) describing the layout of wells and sample that you must create for each plate that you want to analyze.

IMPORTANT: You may need to run the command `dos2unix` to fix line endings on this file before using it!

Example excerpt from a file showing different types of data and formats:
```text

...
Date of measurement: 2019-02-15/Time of measurement: 18:37:05
...other description lines...
```
Format:
* **optional header row** â€“ if missing, assigns the first column to time and then 96 wells in the order: A1, A2, A3...
* **1st column** - contains the times *in seconds* of each measurement. The "s" trailing each number is *optional*."
* **remaining columns** - measurements for a specific well*


It is expected that there are 2 or 3 types of measurements recorded in the file in blocks of rows in this order:
* **OD600 absorbance values**
* **GFP fluorescence values**
* **user defined values (like BFP or RFP)**

## Analyzing Data

The `burden.r` script can be passed arguments to control the analysis of your input files. The most basic command is:

```bash
burden.R --input igem001
```

Try running this on the data found in `examples/igem001`.

## Summary Graphs

This creates a summary graph of growth rate versus GFP production for each strain tested. It can accept multiple input file
prefixes to enable comparing data between multiple `burden.R` runs.

```bash
summary-graph.R --input igem001.rates.summary.csv
```

It can accept multiple input file
prefixes to enable comparing data between multiple `burden.R` runs if you separate them with commas (no spaces allowed by the comma)

```bash
summary-graph.R --input "igem001.rates.summary.csv,igem002.rates.summary.csv"
```
